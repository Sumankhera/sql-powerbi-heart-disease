# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Dataset â€“ SQL Exploration

## About this project
Iâ€™ve started this project to sharpen my **SQL skills** and later bring the results into **Power BI** for visualization.  
The dataset has patient records with details like age, diabetes, blood pressure, lab tests, and whether the patient survived (`death_event`).  

The idea is simple: use data to ask questions, dig into patterns, and share what Iâ€™m learning along the way.

## Current progress
Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve managed so far:
- Turned the Excel file into a **SQLite database** (`heart_disease.db`).
- Set up a `heart_records` table with all patient features and outcomes.
- Written queries to explore:
  - Overall mortality rate  
  - Average age by survival status  
  - Mortality by diabetes and age groups  
  - Mortality by smoking, blood pressure, and sex  

Whatâ€™s next:
- Look into lab values (creatinine, sodium, platelets) and see how they relate to survival.  
- Start building **Power BI dashboards** to turn these insights into visuals.  
- Keep adding my findings here as I go.
