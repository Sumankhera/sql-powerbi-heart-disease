Just started a small exploratory project on heart-disease clinical data — running SQL to look at how common risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, age) relate to mortality. Early, descriptive results suggest higher mortality with hypertension and highlight the need for age-adjusted analysis. Shared the SQL scripts and outputs on GitHub — would love feedback on next steps (Power BI dashboards and a predictive model). Link in the comments.
